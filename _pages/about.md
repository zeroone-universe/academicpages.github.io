I am working as a contract researcher in [SAPL](https://sapl.gist.ac.kr/) at [GIST](https://www.gist.ac.kr/en/main.html). I received my master's and barchelor's degrees from the same lab where I am currently working, advised by [Prof. J. W. Shin](https://sapl.gist.ac.kr/professor). My research interests are **TTS(Text-to-Speech)**, **vocoders**, **speech and audio codecs**, and so on. 

I also worked as a resident DJ & co-organizer of nightclub named [Deepocean Lab](https://www.instagram.com/deepoceanlab_gwangju/?hl=en), where I was able to develop deeper interest in music and audio. Please refer to [this page](https://youngwonchoi.notion.site/ROWON-5d2ebd9bdb964d1a8c689370583659e8) for my DJ presskit (including career and related projects).
