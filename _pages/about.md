I am working as a contract researcher in [SAPL](https://sapl.gist.ac.kr/) at [GIST](https://www.gist.ac.kr/en/main.html). I received my master's degree in 2023 and barchelor's degree in 2021 from the same lab where I am currently working, advised by [Prof. J. W. Shin](https://sapl.gist.ac.kr/professor). My research interests focus on **TTS(Text-to-Speech)**, **vocoders**, and **speech & audio codecs**.
